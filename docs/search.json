With years of experience across diverse educational contexts, I guide future educators to become reflective, equity-focused practitioners who honor students’ diverse backgrounds and adapt to our rapidly changing landscape.\n\n\n\n\n\nReflective & Experiential Learning\n\nTeaching is a continuous journey of reflection and adaptation.

My classroom environment respects individual backgrounds, empowers autonomy, and integrates thoughtful technology use that serves student well-being.\n\n\n\nCollaborative Learning\n\nI create learning communities where peer collaboration is valued and diverse perspectives are celebrated.
