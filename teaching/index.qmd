Learning is a collaborative journey of identity formation. With years of experience across diverse educational contexts, I guide future educators to become reflective, equity-focused practitioners who honor students' diverse backgrounds and adapt to our rapidly changing landscape.

<div class="h3">**Reflective & Experiential Learning**</div>

Teaching is a continuous journey of reflection and adaptation. I create interactive learning environments where teachers and students grow together, examining beliefs and biases while building on cultural assets as strengths.

<div class="h3">**Student-Centered Learning**</div>

I believe students should take ownership of their learning through active participation. My classroom environment respects individual backgrounds, empowers autonomy, and integrates thoughtful technology use that serves student well-being.

<div class="h3">**Collaborative Learning**</div>

I create learning communities where peer collaboration is valued and diverse perspectives are celebrated. Students learn from one another while building professional networks that extend beyond the university classroom.
